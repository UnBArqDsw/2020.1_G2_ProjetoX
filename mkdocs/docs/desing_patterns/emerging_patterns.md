# Emerging Pattern Desing

Emerging design patterns are those associated with the latest platforms and technologies. In our project several of them were implemented and will be discussed in this section.

### List:

#### Back-end

* **S.O.L.I.D**

  - **S** - Single-responsiblity principle;
  - **O** - Open-closed principle;
  - **L** - Liskov substitution principle;
  - **I** - Interface segregation principle;
  - **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle;

* **Dependency injection**

## S.O.L.I.D

> **S.O.L.I.D** is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

Let’s look at each principle individually to understand why S.O.L.I.D can help make us better developers.
