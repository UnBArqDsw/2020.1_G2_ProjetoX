# Tests

Test-driven development is a software development practice advocated in XP and consists of the practice of test-driven development and in TCLDC we inherit this from DDD (domain-driven desing).

Using TDD we program the tests in the extension codes _. Spec.ts_ in order to know the type of result we would like to obtain, with that done the extension code _. Ts_ is done.

As expected from TDD, the project code does unit tests to check every minor part of the system that is decoupled, evaluating the results of classes and methods.

The technology used for _Js_ and _Ts_ tests is Jest to mitigate redundancies and couplings in a backend with node and express, which are some of our technologies. The Jest tool was choosen because it`s fast safe and easy mocking.
