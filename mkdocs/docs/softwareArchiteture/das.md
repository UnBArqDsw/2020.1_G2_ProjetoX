# Software Architecture Document

This document aims to register the architectural structure of the TCLDL website, developed as a final product of the ADS (Architecture and Software Design) discipline, on the Gama campus, at the University of Brasília.
 
The Software Architecture Document demonstrates the set of views that intend to cover the technical and structural aspects related to the development and implementation of the TCLDL website.


## 1. Introduction
This architecture document has the function of specifying and documenting relevant architectural decisions in the production and implementation of the TCLDL website describing aspects of the system in a clear, structured and objective manner.

### 1.1	Purpose

This document applies to the development process of the TLDL website, an application developed in the discipline Architecture and Software Design, at the University of Brasília, in order to provide articles and data to be obtained quickly and easily.
 



### 1.2	Scope

In this project, using the RUP (Rational Unified Process), we start with a typical set of views called "4 + 1 view model".
The different views are listed below and will be addressed in the scope of this document.
 
- Use-Case View
- Logical View
- Implementation View
- Process View
- Deployment Vision
- Data View

## 2. Architectural Representation
### 2.1 Tecnologies
#### 2.1.1 Front-End 

 
The **NextJs** is a react framework that use javascript language and is component oriented. It has some feature like: hybrid static & server rendering, typeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
   
**NextJs** was chosen to be used in the scope of the discipline because almost all members of the team had already had contact with React and the JavaScript language which would facilitate the site development process. In addition, the framework offers easy installation, quick configuration, easy learning, fast performance and several features that facilitate the development process, such as automatic route mapping.
