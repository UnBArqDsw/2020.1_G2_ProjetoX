# Risk Plan

In the estimate the risks of this project, it was decided to establish a standard for the assessment of _probability x impact_, also serving to prioritize risks. See tables bellow:

| Likelihood (L)         | Weight |
|------------------------|--------|
|Rare (< 3%)	         |       1|
|Unlikely (3% - 10%)     | 	     2|
|Moderate (10% - 50%)    |	     3|
|Likely (50% - 90%)      |	     4|
|Almost certain (> 90%)  |	     5|


| Impact (I)         | Weight |
|--------------------|--------|
|Insignificant       |	     1|
|Minor	             |       2|
|Moderate	         |       3|
|Severe	             |       4|
|Critical	         |       5|

At the beginning of each sprinch, each risk is calculated based on the tables presented before. At every new iteration a known and well-mitigated risk in previous sprints always tends to decrease. Knowing this, risks identified during the project tend to have a high impact and need immediate action.

Follows the table for identified risks:

|    id|                                Risk|                                                                                                 Risk response|
