# Methodology

In this project, the group chooses to follow a combination of methodologies. The chosen ones are: Scrum, XP, Kanban.
Of course that only a share of each one of them were used, those which better fits with the project and development situation.

## Scrum

According with the creators and maintainers of the methodology and their website, Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Scrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.
Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

For this project we going to use some rotated posts from scrum as PO, SM, developers and sprints, besides de backlog product.
